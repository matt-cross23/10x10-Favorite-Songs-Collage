## Current standing and steps moving forward
    -Client
        -Build out components
            - Input form, Carosuel for input music, animation at the beginning to introduce site

    -Server
        - Express server is running yet the routes aren't attached
        - Oauth for log in?? Not a priority
        - Create a record of a song if it is not in the database?


    -Database
        - Express server has been created and will most likely connect to application just need to check
        - Need to add the CRUD of records into routes
        - Fill Database with every song haha let's see if you can do that 

    API: Deezer for creating playlist, maybe just use spotify
